# 📊 Employment and Digital Transformation in Ireland

This project explores the relationship between digital transformation and employment trends in Ireland, using publicly available datasets from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The study investigates how digital engagement varies across demographics such as gender, education level, age, and occupation — especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The data was visualized using Tableau, and the insights were compiled into a formal IEEE-style academic report as part of coursework at the National College of Ireland.
